# Face Authentication based attendance System for Anganwadi Schools with FastAPI, OpenCV and React Native

This project implements a face authentication based attendance system and ration tracker using FastAPI for the web server, OpenCV for face recognition and React Native for native android application.

The system allows workers of a Anganwadi school to register their student details along with an clear image of their faces and use them for authentication.

The authentication process is based on comparing the live captured face with the previously registered ones.
